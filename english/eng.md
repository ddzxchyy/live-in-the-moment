### key

1. start with a realistic real world goal you need to have a goal that's tied to the world not just  finishing this this and this today.



2. learning needs to be effective not just getting things done so you have to have a way to measure progress. if you just do the same thing without measuring how much it's helping you improve then well you're wasting time



3. you have to communicate you have to not worry about looking dumb and not worry about being right not worry about being correct all the time it's not that important to be correct it's more important to be natural and it's more important to build confidence 

you have to try to communicate you have to speak if you want to be a good speaker and not just speak the minimum the correct answer



4. you have to build an English brain.



think in English learn English words in English uh use English grammar don't worry about why that word is there or why of instead of for here doesn't matter it is of and not for that's why who cares just learn it learn how to use it right practice it and do it just do it stop asking questions about why doesn't matter why so build your English brain think in English imagine that English is your native language.



5. be consistent work hard .



### goods English

Good English doesn't mean necessarily using advanced words. I should say, what does good English mean? It doesn't mean using advanced words in my opinion. **in most cases it means being clear, making sure that people can understand what you mean, but in general I would say it just means if you have an intention and you try to express that intention to others, are you successful**? if you wanted people to do something and they did it successfully, then that's good, then you've used language successfully.



## keep in mind

**notes**

if you're only listening it may be hard to remember the things that you're learning.
